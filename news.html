      Bruno Fernandes’ injury-time strike spared Manchester United’s blushes, as
      they squeezed to a 2-1 victory over Rangers and moved to within touching
      distance of the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League. The visitors could have
      taken a shock lead early on when Altay Bayindir was forced into a save
      from Rıdvan Yılmaz’s back-post volley. At the other end, Alejandro
      Garnacho looked like The Red Devils’ best attacking outlet, as he had one
      strike deflected over, while Matthijs de Ligt’s header home from the
      resulting corner was chalked off for a foul on Robin Propper. Hamza
      Igamane then had another chance for the Scottish outfit, with a deflection
      meaning it was an awkward save for Bayindir, before, in the dying moments
      of the half, Jack Butland superbly kept out a Lisandro Martinez
      thunderbolt that was heading for the top corner. The goalkeeper turned
      from hero to villain after the break though, as he inadvertently punched
      Christian Eriksen’s corner into his own net to hand United the lead. He
      then made further saves from Garnacho and Manuel Ugarte, which could have
      proved crucial when Cyriel Dessers pounced on a Harry Maguire error to
      equalise late on. But the drama was far from finished, with Fernandes
      sending Old Trafford into delirium with a sweet first-time finish from
      Martinez’s cross in injury time.
