    <h1 id="MANCITY">Manchester City FC</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The Club's roots can be traced back to 1880 and the parish of East
      Manchester. First titled St Mark's West Gorton, the Club became known as
      Manchester City in 1894, and through many ups and downs, it has become one
      of the most recognisable and successful names in the global game.
