    <p>Article 5.1(b) of the National Registration, Status and Transfer Regulations
        (NRSTRs) provides that “a Professional is a Player who has a written
        contract with a Club, under which he or she is paid more than the expenses
        he or she effectively incurs to play football for that Club”. The NRSTRs
        further state that the contract must be in the form of the Professional
        Player Contract (FA Prescribed Form NRR05) and the body of the contract must
        not be amended. Article 5.1(c) of the NRSTRs provides that “An Amateur is
        any Player that is not a Professional. A Club may pay or reimburse a Player
        any expenses incurred by that Player without affecting his or her status as
        an Amateur, including but not limited to travel, kit, equipment or insurance
        premiums. If, however, an Amateur is paid or reimbursed more than $115 a
        week by a Club, the onus is on that Club to satisfy the Competition
        Administrator [Football West] that the amount paid accurately reflects the
        expenses incurred by that Player. If the Club fails to satisfy this onus,
        that Player will be deemed to be a Professional.”</p>
